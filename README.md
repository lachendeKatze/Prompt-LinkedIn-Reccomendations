# Prompt-LinkedIn-Reccomendations
A ChatGPT prompt to help you create personalized LinkedIn Recommendations
## Prompt:
I would like you to help me prepare a concise LinkedIn recommendation statement for a colleague. Please adopt a professional tone but maintain a creative , engaging approach. 

I will provide you with:

basic information and characteristics about my colleague. 
general guidelines  for you to follow.
3 model recommendation statements (a,b,c) for you to learn from and model your statement around.  

Please carefully consider and use the 3 model recommendations I provide as a guide to the tone, style and length I want you to achieve with my statement.

Keep in mind this is a statement for a LinkedIn and not a recommendation letter. 

Provide 2-3 statements for me to select from.

Finally, each statement must  be no longer than 2000 characters long.

1. Basic Information and Characteristics:
   
{first name} = Jane

Endorsed Skills: Pharmacology, Data Analysis, Data Science, In-vivo, Project Planning, Program Management, 

Jane and I worked together for over 3 years on small molecule and gene therapy preclinical development programs. She was a direct report of mine and a key contributor to our team.
She was an in-vivo scientist and researcher for the neurodevelopmental disease gene therapy program I directed. We were teammates on various other therapeutic indications programs at the same time.

Jane was a champion and leader for innovation. She is proficient in in-vivo functional testing and analysis. She is proficient in Noldus Ethovision and knowledge in machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques as they are applied to in-vivo research.

She trained less experienced colleagues in all in-vivo techniques

Jane brings a positive attitude and proactive approach to each day which cascades into her programs and helps to bring success and is especially helpful on the challenging days each program eventually has.
{first name} scientific acumen and knowledge combined with her organizational and orchestration skills allow her to act as a full partner in the drug development program.

Jane also understands that the end product of the drug development program must be safe and efficacious. She always has the patients and caregivers in mind.

2. General Guidelines:
I would like you to start with a line that will get the attention of prospective employers, makes them want to learn more about {first name}, but is not ‘over-the-top’. Remember this is a professional recommendation not a social media hype post.
Give the reader some context as to how you know {first name}  what you worked on together, or the length of time you’ve known each other. 
State one or two things about {first name} this person does better than anything else—or that make them an exceptional colleague in your mind—and focus your recommendation there.
Share about what it’s like to work with {first name}. 
Seal the recommendation statement with a final line that makes it clear that you give your contact an enthusiastic thumbs-up. Make this a single sentence that is short, sweet, and solid.
Don’t ever use the phrase, ‘in summary’.

3. Model Recommendation Statements:
   
One of the values on our engineering team is “constant improvement,” and I’ve never seen anyone embrace and embody that philosophy like Meha. During the past year we’ve worked together, I’ve watched her constantly look for new challenges to tackle, whether it’s getting to the root of a buggy software, writing a script to land a reservation at an always-booked restaurant, or running charity races in her off hours. She’s also always the first to jump in if newer members of the team run into issues. I’ve loved my experience working with Meha, and I know that anyone looking to hire or work with her will, too.

Keeping a project team of 50+ people aligned toward the same tasks might sound impossible, but it seemed like a breeze to Peter. We worked closely together for six months rolling out a new product launch, and I was constantly amazed not only by his technical project management skills, but also by his ability to keep the team motivated through the inevitable challenges and supply chain disruptions. I can honestly say I left every weekly status meeting he led in a better mood. For any company or team that needs a proven PM with a get-it-done-with-a-smile approach, Peter is your guy.

Nikita is a rising star in the PR world. As our team’s account coordinator, she effortlessly juggles reporting, scheduling, and research for five account managers (myself included). But her strengths go far beyond staying on top of our team’s needs and details. She proves her interest and drive in the field daily by going out of her way to make connections with editors and look for outside-the-box opportunities for our clients. (She’s also helped me up my PowerPoint game—big time.) Any PR team would be lucky to have Nikita, and I can’t wait to see where the future takes her.
